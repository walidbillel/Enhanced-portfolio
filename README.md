# Portfolio
This is my updated personal website built using React JS for client side and Express JS for server side.
## Documentation 

| Software        | Version           
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Node JS      |  12.13.0
| Yarn   | 1.15.2 |  
   
## Deploying 
- First of all, cloning the repository by copying the link and running `git clone 'URL'`.
- `cd` your way into the directory, then install all dependencies including the client side ones by running `npm install` and `yarn add` on the client side. 
- run `yarn start` and it will start both development environments, Reactjs and the Express server. You can add anything you want and play around with it.
